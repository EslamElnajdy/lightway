# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do I need to sign a CLA before contributing to Lightway Core?
The reason we have a CLA is to be upfront and transparent about what happens when someone contributes code to the project. It is important to note that the author maintains ownership of the code at all times and that we will immediately release any contributions under the GPL 2.0 license. This helps to protect the project by ensuring that any code in the repository can be released under the GPL 2.0 license both now and in the future. This is why the Apache Foundation requires a CLA for all contributionsâ€”the intent is to protect everyone's interests.

As part of any code contribution, we will list the author's name and what was contributed so that the author will get full recognition for their work.
